===========

A chrome extension to explore synthetic synesthesia.


From wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia
 "Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway
  leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway."

This extension redraws web pages with each letter modified to have a custom colour. For instance you
could make all 'b's become blue, etc. Then you simply read the web page as normal and see if after
some time this induces some synesthetic effects. 

If you want a challenge you can replace the letters completely with solid blocks of colours, b would
become a blue rectangle. Of course reading becomes quite challenging but perhaps this will form 
stronger associations.

Here's the description again, this time in full colour:
