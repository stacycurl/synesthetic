Todo:
- Sync colours choosen with stored options
- Show standalone colours for each letter
   (similar to when you could choose a colour for space)
- Reenable ternary substitution (probably in terms of css rules using 'data images')
- Remove use of canvas in substituting
- Publish on Chrome Web Store
- Add custom image substitutions
- Express ternary as custom image substitution
- Show selected colour in colour picker
- Rotate colour pickers of letters so they are colour aligned with each other)
- Add 'hilbertise' colour (like the image at the bottom of http://corte.si/%2Fposts/code/hilbert/portrait/index.html)
- Figure out how to unify an updatable options with its current value


Done:
+ Populate letter substitution style checkboxes from current config
+ Remove 'substitution style', this can be derived from the checkboxes
+ Expand 'substitution style' to be defined per letter
+ Add 'check all' checkbox
+ Add 'solid' checkboxes to each letter
+ Remove '_'
